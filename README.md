# Fair Food Future

# Introduction:
A personal web app that allow users to learn more about sustainability, food equity, and their relationship. I was inspired by my lack of education on these topics, and wanted to create a clean, simple hub of information for people to learn more about these issues and how they can help.

# Challenges Faced:
I faced difficulties implementing the backend of the site with Firebase hosting, storage, and authentication due to unfamiliarity with the service. However, I learned a lot of new skills in estalishing the Firebase environment and the cloud through this project. 

# Improvements:
In the future, I'd like to add more interactive components to this site which might help users have an even better understanding of sustainability and equity. For example, I might provide a way for users to calculate their carbon footprint, to convey how their lifestyle has an effect on the environment. 

# Built with:
HTML, CSS, React, JSX, Vite, Netlify.
